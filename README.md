# GoodKickOrBadKick
Use a hybrid neural network with the Word2Vec-trained embedding to predict the success or failure of a Kickstarter project.

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity. 

Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. Word2vec was created and published in 2013 by a team of researchers led by Tomas Mikolov at Google and patented.

The Word2Vec-trained word embedding file for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sean49/kickstarter-word2vec-embedding-file).
